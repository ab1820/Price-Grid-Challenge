## Overview

- In this challenge I will be taking my time to make sure I have the entire site accessible, as well as any affects that need attention, making sure my HTML5 markup is semantically proper, and making sure to leave more comments in my CSS for others to understand.
- I am always open to advice in case I missed anything in my code.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process
- My process as always will start with mobile-design first, and then I work my way up through each break point until I reach the largest viewing screen. I will begin with making sure the markup is proper first, then wrapping anything related into divs so I can work with them later on in the CSS. 
- I always have the live preview running at all times to see where I am at, and what will need to be reworked and if I have troubles, I sometimes turn to the wonderful Devtools of Firefox, or just google something I really may need help with.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- I need to learn CSS Grid, as this design was supposed to be built with CSS Grid, but to make things easier for myself, I turned to flexbox.
